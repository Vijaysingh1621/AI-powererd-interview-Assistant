# üéâ AI Interview Assistant with Agentic RAG - COMPLETED!

## ‚úÖ Successfully Implemented Features

### ü§ñ Agentic RAG Pipeline
- **Question Extraction**: Automatically extracts questions from interview transcripts using Gemini AI
- **PDF Search Agent**: Searches uploaded PDFs using Pinecone vector database with OpenAI embeddings
- **Web Search Agent**: Performs web searches using SerpAPI for additional context
- **Context Fusion**: Combines PDF and web search results intelligently
- **Smart Prompting**: Builds optimized prompts with extracted questions and relevant context

### üìÑ PDF Management
- **Upload**: Drag-and-drop or click to upload PDF files
- **Processing**: Automatic text extraction, chunking, and embedding generation
- **Storage**: Secure storage in Pinecone vector database with metadata
- **Deletion**: Remove PDFs and their embeddings from the system

### üéØ Enhanced UI/UX
- **Larger Transcript Box**: More space for interview transcripts
- **AI Mode Toggle**: Switch between regular chat and RAG-enhanced responses
- **Question Display**: Shows extracted questions above AI responses
- **Citations**: Displays sources used in responses with confidence scores
- **PDF Manager**: Integrated file management interface
- **Rebranding**: Updated from "Copilot" to "AI Interview Assistant"

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Improvements
- **Runtime Separation**: Edge runtime for streaming responses, Node.js for heavy processing
- **API Separation**: Dedicated endpoints for RAG processing and PDF management
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks when RAG processing fails
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with proper type definitions

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes (Edge + Node.js runtimes)
- **AI Models**: Google Gemini (chat + question extraction), OpenAI (embeddings)
- **Vector Database**: Pinecone for PDF embeddings and similarity search
- **Web Search**: SerpAPI for real-time web search
- **PDF Processing**: pdf-parse for text extraction
- **Streaming**: Server-sent events for real-time responses

## üîç Testing Scenarios

### Basic RAG Flow
1. Upload a technical PDF (e.g., React documentation)
2. Enter: "I was asked about React hooks in the interview"
3. Verify: Question extracted, PDF searched, web search performed, citations shown

### Fallback Behavior
1. Enter non-question text: "Hello, how are you?"
2. Verify: Normal AI response without RAG processing

### PDF Management
1. Upload multiple PDFs
2. Delete specific PDFs
3. Verify embeddings are properly managed

## üöÄ Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

- [ ] PDF content preview and search
- [ ] Question history and favorites
- [ ] Multiple interview scenarios
- [ ] Advanced citation formatting
- [ ] Performance optimization for large PDF collections
