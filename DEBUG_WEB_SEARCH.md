# Web Search Agent Testing

## Current Status
- ✅ RAG API route is working (fixed 404 issue)
- ✅ Question extraction is working
- ✅ PDF search agent is working
- ❓ Web search agent needs verification

## Environment Setup
The following environment variables are set:
- `SERPAPI_API_KEY`: Configured
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Placeholder (needs real key for PDF processing)
- `PINECONE_API_KEY`: Configured

## Testing Steps

### 1. Test Question Extraction
Input: "I was asked about React hooks in the interview"
Expected: Question should be extracted successfully

### 2. Test Web Search
Input: "What are React hooks and how do they work?"
Expected: 
- Web search should be triggered
- SerpAPI should return results
- Results should be displayed in citations

### 3. Debug Logs to Watch
In the terminal, look for:
- `🌐 Web search called with query: ...`
- `🔑 SerpAPI key configured: YES`
- `🔍 Found X organic results`
- `✅ Web search completed: X results`

## Common Issues

### Issue: Web Search Not Working
**Symptoms**: No web results in citations, only PDF results
**Causes**:
1. SerpAPI key not configured or invalid
2. SerpAPI rate limit exceeded
3. Network connectivity issues
4. Query enhancement making searches too specific

**Solutions**:
1. Verify SerpAPI key at https://serpapi.com/manage-api-key
2. Check SerpAPI usage limits
3. Simplify query enhancement logic
4. Add fallback for failed web searches

### Issue: No Results at All
**Symptoms**: Empty citations array
**Causes**:
1. Question not extracted (confidence < 0.4)
2. Both PDF and web search failing
3. Context combination logic issues

**Solutions**:
1. Lower question extraction confidence threshold
2. Add fallback responses
3. Debug each search agent individually

## Current Implementation
- RAG orchestrator calls PDF and web search in parallel
- Web search uses SerpAPI with query enhancement
- Results are combined and sorted by relevance score
- Top 8 results are used for context generation

## Next Steps
1. Test with the actual UI to see console logs
2. Verify web search is being called and returning results
3. If web search fails, investigate SerpAPI configuration
4. Consider adding mock web search results for testing
