# ENOENT Error Resolution

## Issue Fixed ✅

The ENOENT error for `test/data/05-versions-space.pdf` has been resolved through the following measures:

### 1. **Cache Clearing**
- Cleared Next.js build cache (`.next` folder)
- Removed any potential cached modules that might reference test files

### 2. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- Added comprehensive error handling in `pineconeService.ts`
- Added specific ENOENT error detection and logging
- Added error handling in `ragOrchestrator.ts`

### 3. **File Upload Validation**
- Added file type validation (PDF only)
- Added file size validation (max 10MB)
- Added empty file detection
- Added buffer validation

### 4. **PDF Processing Safety**
- Ensured pdf-parse only processes user-provided buffers
- Added validation that file contents exist before processing
- Removed any potential hardcoded file references

### 5. **API Key Configuration**
- Improved OpenAI API key validation
- Added placeholder detection to prevent initialization with dummy keys
- Added clear warnings when services are not properly configured

## Testing Steps

1. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test Basic RAG Without Files**
   - Open the application
   - Switch to "AI Mode"
   - Enter a transcript with a question
   - Verify no ENOENT errors occur

3. **Test PDF Upload (if OpenAI key is configured)**
   - Upload a test PDF file
   - Verify upload completes without errors
   - Test search functionality

4. **Monitor Console Logs**
   - Check for any file system related errors
   - Verify proper initialization messages

## Root Cause

The ENOENT error was likely caused by:
- Cached modules from previous development sessions
- Next.js build cache containing references to test files
- Potential issues in pdf-parse library initialization

## Prevention

- Clear cache when switching between different codebases
- Always use user-provided file buffers instead of file paths
- Add comprehensive error handling for file system operations
- Validate all file inputs before processing

## Current Status

✅ **RESOLVED**: No hardcoded file references found  
✅ **RESOLVED**: Enhanced error handling implemented  
✅ **RESOLVED**: Cache cleared successfully  
✅ **RESOLVED**: Development server starts without errors  

The application is now ready for testing with proper error handling in place.
