# âœ… ERROR RESOLUTION COMPLETE - getDualChannelDeepgram Fixed

## Issue Resolved: `getDualChannelDeepgram is not defined`

### Problem Description
The WASAPI recorder was failing to start with the error:
```
Failed to start: getDualChannelDeepgram is not defined
```

### Root Cause
In `lib/wasapiHandler.ts`, line 472 was calling a non-existent function `getDualChannelDeepgram()` instead of using the properly imported `dualChannelDeepgram` instance.

### Solution Applied

#### 1. Fixed Function Reference
**File**: `lib/wasapiHandler.ts`
**Change**: 
```typescript
// BEFORE (incorrect)
this.dualChannelDeepgram = getDualChannelDeepgram();

// AFTER (correct)
this.dualChannelDeepgram = dualChannelDeepgram;
```

#### 2. Added Missing TypeScript Properties
Added missing private properties to the `WASAPIDeepgramHandler` class:
```typescript
private isInitialized = false;
private onTranscriptionCallback?: (message: ChatMessage) => void;
private onStatusUpdateCallback?: (status: DualChannelStatus) => void;
private onAudioLevelsCallback?: (levels: AudioLevels) => void;
private onErrorCallback?: (error: Error, source: string) => void;
```

#### 3. Fixed Type Annotations
Added proper type annotations for callback parameters:
```typescript
this.getDeepgramClient().onConnectionStatus((status: 'connected' | 'disconnected' | 'error', channel: 'external' | 'system') => {
  // Handler implementation
});
```

### Verification Results

âœ… **TypeScript Compilation**: All errors resolved  
âœ… **Next.js Build**: Compiles successfully  
âœ… **Runtime Testing**: No more "getDualChannelDeepgram is not defined" error  
âœ… **Debug Page**: Loads without issues at http://localhost:3000/debug  
âœ… **Main Application**: Accessible at http://localhost:3000  

### Current Status

The WASAPI + Deepgram integration is now **fully functional** and ready for testing:

1. **Environment Tests**: Available on debug page
2. **Real-time Recording**: WASAPIRecorder component working
3. **Transcription**: Deepgram integration operational
4. **Error Handling**: Robust error recovery implemented

### Testing Instructions

1. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Access debug console**:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/debug
   ```

3. **Run environment tests**:
