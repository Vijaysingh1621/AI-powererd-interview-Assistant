# RAG Web Search Migration Complete

## ✅ Successfully Migrated from SerpAPI to Tavily

The web search functionality has been successfully migrated from SerpAPI to Tavily API for better reliability and performance.

### Changes Made:

1. **Replaced SerpAPI with Tavily API**
   - Removed `serpapi` dependency 
   - Added `@tavily/core` package
   - Updated web search agent implementation

2. **Updated Environment Configuration**
   - Replaced `SERPAPI_API_KEY` with `TAVILY_API_KEY`
   - Updated `.env` and `.env.example` files

3. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Added fallback results when API key is not configured
   - Better error logging and network issue detection
   - Graceful degradation for web search failures

4. **Improved Search Results**
   - Leverages Tavily's built-in answer feature
   - Better relevance scoring
   - Enhanced query enhancement for interview context

### Current Status:

✅ **COMPLETE**: Tavily API integration implemented  
✅ **COMPLETE**: Environment configuration updated  
✅ **COMPLETE**: Error handling and fallbacks added  
✅ **COMPLETE**: RAG orchestrator updated to use new web search  

### Next Steps:

1. **Configure Tavily API Key**
   - Sign up at [tavily.com](https://tavily.com) for a free API key
   - Replace `tvly-placeholder-add-your-tavily-key-here` in `.env` with your actual key

2. **Test Web Search Integration**
   - The web search agent will work with mock/fallback results until API key is configured
   - Once configured, it will provide real web search results for RAG

3. **Test Full RAG Pipeline**
   - Try using AI mode with interview questions
   - Verify web search results appear in citations
   - Test question extraction and context combination

The web search functionality is now more reliable and should resolve the previous ENOTFOUND errors with SerpAPI.
